Blog
===================

This is a simple, static and minimalistic blog "framework".

Posts are partial html files located in the /content folder, along with index.json used for keeping post links, title, dates and for generating archive page.

With this kind of framework, there is no need for a dev environment of any sorts to add or modify content. All that is needed is a modern browser.
