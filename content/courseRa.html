    Finished a fun <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming">R programming course</a> 
    at Coursera - only 4 weeks long. Although boxed for 4 weeks, with enough motivation one can easily finish 
    it within a week.

    Most of the coursework covers many different ways to query, filter and aggregate data frames. Almost can replace SQL.
