After getting a chance to review few applications and test 
programs from potential hires, I have an idea for a 
college course - 'Real-life Software Development.' 
Well, maybe not a real course but a course project that heavily 
stresses the ability of quickly reading other people's code.</p>

First and foremost, anyone starting a programming career should be 
prepared to read allot of code. If you get a programming 
job, it's very typical to have the first month on the job 
entirely devoted to reading and getting familiar with companies 
existing code. The faster you can read and understand that 
code the more value you bring to your employer.</p>

Being able to quickly read other people's code is a required  
skill that can only be taught by reading a lot of code,  
not developing stuff from scratch. Note the quote in the begining
of thie post. But what about code comments you might ask?
People who write good code comments are rare and don't write many comments, after  
all, this is software engineering field not literature.  
But there are usually plenty of bad comments which make reading code  
a much easier and faster way to understand the program.</p>

So, the basic idea for the course is to let students pick an open source 
project that they love and use (maybe a single project for 
entire class) and from the beginning of the course define 
a reasonable set of features that could improve the project. 
Then spend the rest of the course helping students to simply 
read and understand as much of already existing code as possible and teach 
software engineering principles, such as repository system, 
design patterns, etc.</p>

Another idea is to have an school college project, like a 
game engine that is used in other courses and have a list of features 
that students can improve the software with (regardless 
if they have used the game engine themselves or not) and throughout the course 
have them implement those features. At the conclusion of the 
course, roll back repository to pre-features revision and 
get ready for another class. If embedded engineering course  
can require students to build elevator controller every single  
year, having student implement same software feature every  
year is not that bad because the goal is not to improve software  
but simply train the skill of quickly reading and understanding code.</p>

It would be an interesting study to measure code reading performance 
before and after having students train to read existing code for a month. 
Maybe time a control and fresh student group in reading a page or two of Java and 
describe in plain English what that code does.</p>

In any case, looking back at my college years, having a course like 
that would have been very beneficial.</p>
