Like millions of other folks, I have a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/">smart</a> TV, 
or simply a tiny android box that plays Youtube music and Amazon Prime videos.
I also like to run <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> firewall, with pretty much 
out-of-the-box setup.
</p>

While checking firewall logs, and reviewing the usual scans for open ports 23/22 on my network, 
I decided to start blocking certain geolocations. That's when I noticed my smart TV is sending data 
to two IPs in China, about every other minute.

Launching adb, android debugger and digging deeper -- the app responsible for those pings is 
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplaydmr2&hl=en">com.waxrain.airplaydmr2</a>, 
one of only 3 custom apps installed on the device.
</p>

This got me curious of what other traffic this smart TV is leaking. Among the 
usual Nvidia telemetry (even though it was explicitly disabled in the OS setttings), 
there is chatter to Adobe, Facebook and a bit of others.

</p>

With pfSense however, we can easily quiet this chatter down a bit.
</p>

<h3>0. Strategy</h3>
First, we need to decide which traffic we care about. 
I only care about youtube and amazon at this point, and while those two also query a ton of telemetry  
we'll just have to take the bad with the good here. But outside of those two services, 
the smart TV should be completely silent and invisible to the outside world.
</p>

In order to block WAN traffic, we will use a pfBlockerNG to isolate  
<a href="https://bgp.he.net/search?search%5Bsearch%5D=google&commit=Search">google</a>, 
<a href="https://bgp.he.net/search?search%5Bsearch%5D=amazon&commit=Search">amazon</a>, 
and <a href="https://bgp.he.net/search?search%5Bsearch%5D=akamai&commit=Search">akamai</a> 
(content delivery service for amazon video) using 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">ASN</a>s. 
Upon feed updates, pfBlockerNG will resolve those ASNs to IP addresses which we can reference in 
firewall rules.
</p>

<h3>1. pfBlockerNG alias</h3>
Navigate to <b>Firewall / pfBlockerNG / IPv4</b>, click Add. Come up with a cool name (tv_whitelist), set List 
Action: Alias Native, which means pfBlockerNG will only create firewall alias (<b>Firewall / Aliases / URLs</b>), 
and won't be adding any firewall rules. 
In IPv4 Custom List tab, check Enable Domain/AS and paste following ASNs into Custom Address(es).

<pre>
AS15169
AS36040
AS22577
AS36561
AS14618
AS16509
AS11344
AS19047
AS7224
AS6432
AS16550
AS62785
AS58588
AS393560
AS393234
AS36183
AS35994
AS35993
AS32787
AS30675
AS23455

AS20189
AS18717
AS18680
AS17334
AS16702
AS16625
AS12222
</pre>

Once this alias is saved, run pfBlockerNG update and reload steps on <b>Firewall / pfBlockerNG / Update</b> page. 
The log should state that a few thousands of IPs have been added, about 19000 as of this writting.</p>

<h3>2. Firewall rules</h3>
With pfBlockerNG alias in place, on WAN firewall page (<b>Firewall / Rules / WAN</b>) add a new rule, 
with Action: Block, set Destination to 
the IP of smart TV, and set Source referencing pfBlockerNG alias (in my case pfB_tv_whitelist) and check Invert 
match option. Since this rule is blocking, Invert match will treat those IPs as a whitelist.</p>

Similarly on LAN (<b>Firewall / Rules / LAN</b>), add a rule to Invert match on Destination, set Source as 
Single host with IP of the smart TV. It helps with testing to enable Log in Extra Options tab.</p>

If you still want your smart TV to communicate with other devices on LAN, like DNS/DHCP or debugging over WiFi, 
then add another rule on LAN page, set Action to Pass, Source: smart TV IP, Destination: LAN net, 
and make sure it's above the blocking rule. In the end it should look something like this:

</p>

<h3>3. Testing</h3>
If logging is enabled, you can check for blocked traffic on <b>Firewall / pfBlockerNG / Alerts</b> page.

</p>

Another way to test is to block a different device on your network, like a smart phone, and verify that 
you can still reach youtube and amazon on that device and nothing else.
