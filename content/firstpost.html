<a href="https://github.com/vitalius/vitalius.github.com">This is a simple, static and minimalistic blog "framework"</a>.</p>

Posts are partial html files located in the /content folder, along with index.json for post index.</p>

With this kind of framework, there is no need for a dev environment of any sorts to add or modify content.</p>
