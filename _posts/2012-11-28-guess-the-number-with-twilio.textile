Sometime in 8th grade at Cascade Middle School in Vancouver, I came across a very old introductory to programming book. The book contained examples of simple text games written in Basic and I guess some pictures and some text.

I particularly liked "Guess the Number":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1lEroqZtZw, so much that I neatly copied the source code into a notebook so that I could copy it into other, old computers that had Basic and impress my friends with l33t hax0r skillz.

When my "brother":http://avpsocialmedia.com/ showed me "Twilio":http://www.twilio.com/ and after looking at their API, I simply couldn't wait to make the silly game again.

It's the same "Guess the Number":https://github.com/vitalius/guess-game game, but over a phone line, using Twilio's API and with some valuable business advice as a prize ;)
