When I had 1TB hard disk drive I didn't care what amount 
  of space it takes to install an OS. After switching to 120GB SSD 
  however, space
  on drive <code>C:\</code> begins to matter. Full installation 
  of Windows 8.1 takes about 15GB and it was very surprising
  to see only 50GB left on 120GB SSD.
  </p>
  
  Where did 60+GB go?</p>

  Running Disk Cleanups didn't reveal any magical space drainage either. 
  I started to suspect a few SSD chips gone bad and now 
  half of the drive is simply unusable.

  Turs out, Windows has two very-hidden files <code>C:\pagefile.sys</code> and 
  <code>C:\hiberfil.sys</code>. So hidden that if you turn on the show hidden 
  files feature in Explorer, they still remain hidden. In fact, even if you run 
  <code>C:\&gt;dir</code> as Administrator you still won't see them. 
  It was only with the help of <a href='http://www.cygwin.com/'>cygwin</a>
  that I noticed those files at all.</p>
 
  <ul>
   <li><code>pagefile.sys</code> is a Windows version of swap partition. 
       Normally, it is equivalent in size to the amount of system's ram
       and in my case it's a whooping 32GB file. Pagefiles can be disabled 
       all-together moved to a different drive or modified to a custom size 
       but by default they seem to be same size as ram and stuck on <code>C:\</code>
   </li>
   <li><code>hiberfil.sys</code> The secret sauce behind Windows fast 
       boot-up and the cache file for OS state when hibernating. 
       Also pretty large on my system, 26GB.
   </li>
  </ul></p>
  
  With those two hidden files and OS installation, space allocation
  is finally making sense.
