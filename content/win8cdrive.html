<p>With 1TB hard disk drive, I didn't care about the amount of space taken by OS. But after switching to a much smaller drive, 120GB SSD, space on drive <code>C:\</code> becomes precious. So it was very surprising to see only 50GB left just after installing Win 8.1 on an empty drive.
</p>

<p>Full installation of Win 8.1 takes only about 15GB. Where did 60+GB go?</p>

  <p>Running Disk Cleanups didn't reveal any magical space drainage either. 
  I even suspected a few SSD chips gone bad and now 
  half of the drive is simply unusable.
  </p>

  <p>Turns out, Windows has two very-hidden files <code>C:\pagefile.sys</code> and 
  <code>C:\hiberfil.sys</code>. So hidden that if you turn on the show hidden 
  files feature in Explorer, they still remain hidden. Even if you run 
  <code>C:\&gt;dir</code> as Administrator you still won't see them. 
  I only came across them by accident with Cygwin.</p>
 
  <p><ul>
   <li><code>pagefile.sys</code> is a Windows version of swap partition. 
       Normally, it is equivalent in size to the amount of system's ram
       and in my case it's a whooping 32GB file. Pagefiles can be disabled 
       all-together moved to a different drive or modified to a custom size 
       but by default they seem to be same size as ram and stuck on <code>C:\</code>
   </li>
   <li><code>hiberfil.sys</code> The secret sauce behind Windows fast 
       boot-up and the cache file for OS state when hibernating. 
       Also pretty large on my system, 26GB.
   </li>
  </ul></p>
  
  Finally windows space allocation is making sense.
