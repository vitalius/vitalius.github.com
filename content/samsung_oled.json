After using Samsung Galaxy S2 for about two years, 
I was convinced that all android apps have this nice, 
subtle, noise texture on all gradient UI elements. </p>

Here is a picture of android keyboard, a bad iPhone 
camera gives a bit more emphasis on the gradients granularity. </p>

It was surprising and a bit unnerving to see the same 
apps on Nexus 5. All those smooth, gliding gradients kept bringing up 
memories like upgrading a video card on an old 486 box 
and running Windows 95 with 16 bit color for the first time. </p>

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED'>Super Amoled</a> 
display works by having each pixel represented by three light 
emitting sub-pixels (Red, Green, Blue). Those sub-pixels have 
more limited lifespan than a typical light source of traditional 
back-lit screens. The balance between their lifespan 
and intensity is very delicate, apparently making it very hard to display 
a consistent gradient.</p>

Ignoring the difference in resolution, the grainy gradient is still 
pretty visible on Galaxy S2 (left) vs Nexus 5 (right).</p>

Nexus 5 comes with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel'>IPS</a> 
screen and although I miss S2's black colors (when pixel is completely off 
and no light is emitted at all), the smooth gradients, higher resolution 
and just over all a healthy looking screen of Nexus 5 is an amazing upgrade.
