Writing is good for the soul, they say. Writing with tools like Emacs, Ruby and GitHub is probably good for few other things as well. Finally found a simple minimalistic "theme":https://github.com/jtoy/jtoyblog for "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll.

Writing with a static site generator feels very much like writing software. First, in a simple text editor, one derives the logic and writes a post then few Ruby scripts compile the result into proper HTML and link all images, CSS and JavaScript libraries. Now, the static site is ready to be served by pretty much any web server and a web browser can accompany each post with fancy layout and visual appeal.
